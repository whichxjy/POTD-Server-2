This Is Just To Say 
------------------------------------------------------------------
BY WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS
------------------------------------------------------------------
I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold

Poem (As the cat)
------------------------------------------------------------------
BY WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS
------------------------------------------------------------------
As the cat
climbed over
the top of

the jamcloset
first the right
forefoot

carefully
then the hind
stepped down
into the pit of
the empty
flowerpot

Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening
------------------------------------------------------------------
BY ROBERT FROST
------------------------------------------------------------------
Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village, though; 
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
